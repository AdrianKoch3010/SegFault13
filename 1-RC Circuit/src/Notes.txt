Capacitor current i_c (t)  = (Cd_v (t))/dt

Since current is constant throughout the series circuit i_c(t) = i(t)

Potential Difference between the resistor V_R= i(t)R

Substituting i(t)  with (Cd_v (t))/dt  

V_in (t)= V_R (t)+ V_C (t)

Substituting V_R (t)  with RC (dv_c (t))/dt
V_in(t) = RC (dv_c (t))/dt+ V_c (t)

Let y = V_c (t)

Then 

RCy ̇+y= V_in(t) 

For R = 1kΩ , C =100nF,
0.0001y ̇+y= V_in(t) 

The solution for this circuit is:

Runge-Kutta 2nd order method:
et i=0, hence y_i= y_0, y_i+1 = y_1

We get y_1= y_0+ (a_1 k_1+ a_2 k_2 )h

And that k_1= f(x_0, y_0 )
And k_2= f(x_0+ ph  y_0+ qk_1 h
Substituting k_1  into the k_2  equation, 
K_2= f[x_0+ ph, y_0+ qh�(x_0, y_0 )]

We then solve for y_1  , and set the value of using x_1  and y_1  we can increment to find x_2  and y_2.
